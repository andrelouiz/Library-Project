Create a batch file (or a set of batch files) which will allow us to create delete and search bibliographic records. 

Each record should be a text file containing some lines. Each line should contain field type (eg. word “author” or “title”) and field contents. 

eg. 



author: John Smith
author: Jerry Brown
title: Interesting notes on Gargmel’s cat
pages: 1200
year: 2019



The batch file (or batch files) should allow to add such record

Delete file containing a record
and search records on author and title.
For searching records use awk.
