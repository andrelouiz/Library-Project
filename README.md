<p id="description">Library Project

Created a batch file which will allow us to create delete and search bibliographic records. Each record should be a text file containing some lines. Each line should contain field type (eg. word “author” or “title”) and field contents. 

eg. 
<p>
<li>author: John Smith author: Jerry Brown </li>
<li>title: Interesting notes on Gargmel’s cat </li>
<li>pages: 1200 year: 2019 </li>
</p>

The batch file (or batch files) should allow to add such record Delete file containing a record and search records on author and title. For searching records use awk.</p>
